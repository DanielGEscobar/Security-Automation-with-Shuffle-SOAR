# Security Automation with Shuffle SOAR

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

This project focuses on automating security operations using Shuffle SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) to streamline incident response, improve threat detection, and reduce response times. Shuffle SOAR is an open-source platform designed to simplify the automation of security workflows, enabling the orchestration of tools and processes for faster, more efficient security operations.

By implementing a security automation pipeline using Shuffle SOAR, this project aims to demonstrate how automating manual processes can improve the overall efficiency of security teams while also enhancing the accuracy and consistency of responses to security incidents.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Automation: Designing and automating security workflows to improve the efficiency of security operations.
- Orchestration and Integration: Integrating various security tools (SIEM, threat intelligence, EDR) and automating their coordination.
- Incident Response: Implementing automated processes for handling common security incidents such as phishing, malware, and unauthorized access.
- Threat Intelligence: Automating threat intelligence gathering, analysis, and correlation to enhance security posture.
- Process Optimization: Testing and optimizing automated workflows to improve performance and response times.
- Continuous Monitoring: Setting up real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting systems to track security incidents and performance.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Shuffle SOAR – The core platform for automating workflows and orchestrating security tools.
- SIEM (Splunk) – A Security Information and Event Management solution for collecting, analyzing, and correlating security data from various sources.
- Threat Intelligence Platform (MISP) – A platform for gathering, sharing, and correlating threat intelligence data.
- Firewalls (pfSense) – A network firewall for managing incoming/outgoing traffic and blocking malicious IP addresses.
- Endpoint Detection & Response (CrowdStrike) – A tool to detect, prevent, and respond to endpoint threats in real-time.
- Jira Service Management – A service desk platform used to create, manage, and track security incidents.
- VirusTotal – A service for scanning files and URLs to detect malware and other security risks.
- Slack – A communication tool for alerting and real-time team collaboration.

## Steps
1. Setup and Configuration of Shuffle SOAR
Objective: Install and configure Shuffle SOAR on a secure environment to create an automation hub.

Steps:

Deploy Shuffle SOAR on a virtual machine or cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, or on-premises).
Install dependencies such as Docker (if using containerization) and configure system settings.
Set up the Shuffle SOAR instance, including user roles, permissions, and basic configurations.
Integrate Shuffle SOAR with existing tools such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions, firewalls, ticketing systems, and threat intelligence platforms.
Skills Acquired:

Virtual machine and cloud environment configuration.
Software installation and system configuration.
Integration with third-party security tools and systems.

2. Create Playbooks for Automated Incident Response
Objective: Develop and implement security playbooks to automate standard incident response procedures.

Steps:

Define common security incident types (e.g., phishing, malware, DDoS attacks, unauthorized access).
Create playbooks for each incident type using Shuffle SOAR’s drag-and-drop interface or Python scripts.
For example, a phishing playbook may involve steps such as:
Collecting email headers.
Performing a URL analysis through a threat intelligence platform.
Triggering alerts and creating tickets for investigation.
Blocking malicious IPs and quarantining affected endpoints.
Ensure that each playbook can automatically interact with existing tools (e.g., SIEMs, firewalls, EDR systems, ticketing systems) to gather data and take appropriate actions.
Skills Acquired:

Playbook design and workflow automation.
Incident response planning and execution.
Integrating Shuffle SOAR with SIEM tools, ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow), and endpoint detection platforms.

3. Automate Threat Intelligence Collection and Correlation
Objective: Automate the collection and enrichment of threat intelligence for faster decision-making.

Steps:

Configure Shuffle SOAR to pull threat intelligence from various sources such as threat intelligence platforms (e.g., MISP, AlienVault, VirusTotal).
Automate the correlation of threat data with existing security logs (e.g., firewall logs, web server logs).
Implement rules in Shuffle SOAR to trigger alerts or response actions based on threat intelligence data (e.g., blocking IP addresses, adding indicators to blocklists).
Skills Acquired:

Threat intelligence automation and enrichment.
Data correlation and integration with external threat feeds.
Proactive threat hunting and early detection of attacks.

4. Incident Ticketing and Response Workflow
Objective: Integrate Shuffle SOAR with ticketing systems to automatically create, assign, and close incident tickets based on predefined playbooks.

Steps:

Integrate Shuffle SOAR with a ticketing system like Jira or ServiceNow to automate the creation of tickets when a security incident is detected.
Configure the system to assign tickets to appropriate security analysts or teams based on severity and workload.
Set up automated responses such as sending email notifications, generating reports, or executing specific remediation actions (e.g., blocking IPs, quarantining infected systems).
Skills Acquired:

Incident management automation.
Integration of automation tools with ticketing systems.
Incident prioritization and task delegation.

5. Continuous Monitoring and Incident Reporting
Objective: Set up continuous monitoring and automated reporting to provide real-time visibility into security incidents and system health.

Steps:

Develop automated reporting systems that deliver daily or weekly summaries of incidents, automated responses, and system performance.
Implement dashboards within Shuffle SOAR or external visualization tools to provide live monitoring of security incidents, response times, and overall effectiveness of automation.
Utilize alerting and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) integrated with Shuffle SOAR for real-time visibility.
Skills Acquired:

Continuous monitoring and reporting automation.
Dashboards and data visualization.
Metrics-based performance analysis of security operations.

6. Testing and Optimization of Playbooks
Objective: Continuously test and optimize the playbooks to ensure they function as expected in various scenarios.

Steps:

Perform simulated attacks (e.g., red team exercises or tabletop exercises) to validate the functionality of the playbooks.
Monitor how the automation handles real-world threats and make adjustments based on performance.
Optimize playbook response times and ensure the workflows are efficient, ensuring that every automated step is necessary and effective.
Skills Acquired:

Automated testing of security processes.
Playbook optimization and fine-tuning.
Real-time response handling and simulation of attack scenarios.
